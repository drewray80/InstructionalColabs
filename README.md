# InstructionalColabs
Used for programming instruction in my high school courses

This repo is for personal storage of the colabs that I use to teach my high school programming classes.
As a teacher, it is helpful to get ideas from other teachers, then use those ideas in our own way.
That is the reason that I made this repo public.

I have colabs to be a great way to teach Python programming.


I don't really see any reason to provide a license, since these colabs wouldn't have use in a commercial project.
If anyone knows a good reason to provide a license, let me know.

I try to provide references for the material that I use. 
If I miss any references, these colabs are used for educational purposes only.
