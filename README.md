# Instructional Colabs
Used for programming instruction in my high school courses

This repo is for personal storage of the colabs that I use to teach my high school programming classes.
As a teacher, it is helpful to get ideas from other teachers, then use those ideas in our own way.
That is the reason that I made this repo public.

I have found colabs to be a great way to teach Python programming.
Jupyter notebooks are helpful to provide notes in text cells, 
and allow students to actively participate by writing Python in the code cells.
Students can also use them to write programs outside of the classroom on their Chromebooks 
without needing a computer with Python installed.

Using colabs for notes also prepares students to use Jupyter notebooks in college,
and as they advance in programming to working on data analysis projects.

Colabs also let students install and interact with open source LLMs and other AI models.
But, this repo doesn't have any of those notebooks, just notes sections.

I don't really see any reason to provide a license, since these colabs wouldn't have use in a commercial project.
If anyone knows a good reason to provide a license, let me know.

I try to provide references for the material that I use. 
If I miss any references, these colabs are used for educational purposes only.
